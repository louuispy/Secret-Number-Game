# Secret Number Guessing Game

Hi everyone!

This project was created when I was studying ONE: *Programing Logic* course. 

In this course, I learned about Programing Logic with Javascript, creating a secret number guessing game from zero to deploy.

```
Technologies that I used:
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Responsive Voice
```

# How can I play the game?

You can play the game in the oficial website of the project.

https://secret-number-game-flax.vercel.app/

Other way that you can play the game is clonning the repository to you own machine and running the project.

```
Requirements to run in your own machine:
- Node.js
```

I hope you enjoy it! 😁
